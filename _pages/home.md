Welcome to the webpage of the **Program Analysis Group (ICT-PAG)**. We are based in the [State Key Lab of Processors](https://sklp.ict.ac.cn/) at [Institute of Computing Technology, UCAS](http://english.ict.cas.cn/). Our focus is on developing program analysis techniques and tools to enhance software reliability and security. Our research has successfully identified numerous errors and potential vulnerabilities in popular open-source applications, with over 200 bugs confirmed by original developers and more than 20 assigned CVEs. Our research has been published in top conferences such as SOSP, CCS, USENIX SECURITY, FSE, ASE, and CGO. We have received the ASE distinguished paper award and the CCS best paper honorable mention in 2019 and 2022, respectively.
